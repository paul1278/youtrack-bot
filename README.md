# YouTrack-Bot
This is a super simple implementation of a small bot for YouTrack.
It solves the __issue__ of creating scheduled issues on YouTrack.

The interface provides a simple configuration using YAML-files to define all your fields and to use them easily on tickets you might want to create.

## Requirements
* PHP 7 / 8
* php-curl
* php-yaml
* Some scheduler like `cron` - or even web-based.

## Usage
* Extract the latest version of this project.
* Copy `config.dist.php` to `config.php` and edit the needed values.
* Copy the examples from the `examples`-folder, remove the `.dist` from their names and edit them accordingly.
TODO: Instructions will follow.
